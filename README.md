# Nim_Game
This program is for playing a variation of the Subtraction game called the game of NIM.
The game starts with up to 15 rods and up to 10 objects in each rod. Two players take turns removing objects from the rods. On a player's turn, she chooses a rod and removes one or more objects from that rod. She can remove all objects from the rod. The player who takes the last object from the rods (so that all rods are empty) wins.
